This is a wireframe example of what we can create using Hugo.
Actual content management is a breeze and can even be managed
through a web-based CMS.

It is not meant to replace or supplant the hard work done by
our fearless leader, unless he finds it useful.

The data for this website is hosted at
https://github.com/goattrails/hb-goattrails

All content and pages are written in Markdown, a simplifed text
format that can be converted to HTML.  Widgets like calendars
and countdown timers and GPX maps are invoked through shortcodes.
